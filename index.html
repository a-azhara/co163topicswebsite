			<h2>Problem</h2>
			<p>Every day, millions of people
				use search engines on their smart
				devices
				to find information they need on
				the
				web. These requests are called
				queries,
				and contain one or more keywords
				on the topic of interest. In
				order to
				personalise their search, web
				search service providers keep a
				record
				of
				the user's information, such as
				their previous queries, current
				location
				and
				cookies.</p>
			<p>However, submitted search queries
				may
				potentially
				contain sensitive information about
				the user such as health problems or
				income level.<a href="#ref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
				The leakage of
				this information to search engines
				has led to widespread privacy
				infringement and
				remains a pressing issue today.</p><br>
			<div class="container-fluid">

			</div>
			<br>
			<h2>Solution</h2>
			<p>One proposed solution to
				this problem is query obfuscation.
				It is
				the process of sending out the real
				search query together with many
				dummy
				(fake) queries to the search engine
				or adversary, thus, hindering the
				identification of the original
				query. This makes it difficult to
				profile
				the user and retrieve any sensitive
				data about them.</p>
			<p>Although
				the
				topic of query obfuscation is still
				under-researched, there exists a
				real
				world obfuscator called TrackMeNot
				which was created by a team of
				researchers from New York
				University in 2006.<a href="#ref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
				TrackMeNot is a browser plugin that
				performs query obfuscation and can
				be
				applied to the majority of web
				search service providers. The
				software
				works by periodically sending
				queries to popular search engines. However, according to
				the Chrome<a href="#ref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
				and
				FireFox<a href="#ref5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
				Web
				Stores, TrackMeNot remains
				unpopular as there are only 40, 937
				users (as of 29 January 2019).
				Moreover, it is ineffective as adversaries can easily
				expose its "noisy" queries via
				machine
				learning.<a href="#ref6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>

				<img src="https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~aa19418/css/img/icons-hypothesis.png" alt="Hypothesis" class="lorimond-img analysis-icon">
			</div>
			<br>
			<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
			<p>In theory, query obfuscation is
				a viable solution to prevent user
				profiling. However, in practice,
				it is highly challenging to create
				an effective query obfuscator that
				would eliminate the problem
				completely.</p>
			<p>The
				following pages describe the 3
				elementary requirements of a
				query
				obfuscator, as well as explain the
				reasoning behind the above
				hypothesis.</p>
		</div>
		<br><br>
		<div id="section3" class="container-fluid">
			<div class="parallax background3">
				<br><br><br><br>
				<h1 class="blackfont"><b>1.
						Indistinguishability</b></h1><br><br><br>
			</div>
			<br><br>
			<p class="requirement">The first
				fundamental requirement
				for a query obfuscator is
				<b>indistinguishability</b>.</p>
			<p>An
				obfuscator aims to obscure the true
				query, and one way of achieving this is
				to create a few dummy queries and
				hide
				the original within them.</p>
			<p>However,
				most people tend to have a certain
				writing style, which is described
				by
				their language habits and search
				patterns. As such, if the obfuscator
				uses a standard query-generating
				algorithm, it will be relatively
				easy for adversaries to pick out
				the
				true
				query. </p>
			<p>Take an example of a
				teenager who often uses
				catchphrases
				and
				abbreviations. He might search "wht
				does quary obfuscators acc do",
				which
				contains typographical errors,
				abbreviations and grammar mistakes.
				Then his
				query obfuscator generates various
				'standard' dummy queries (e.g. "Which
				is
				the brightest star in the night
				sky?") and sends them to the search
				engine.
				However, since the search engine
				adversary
				is able to extract his writing
				style
				from his previous queries, it can
				determine the original request. </p>

				<source src="https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~aa19418/css/img/indist_without.mp4" class="video">Your browser does
				not
				support the video tag. </video>
			<p class="caption">An example of
				query obfuscation without
				indistinguishability</p>
			<br>
			<p>Hence,
				the obfuscator must generate
				dummy queries that are
				indistinguishable from the true
				query. In general,
				the obfuscator can achieve this by learning the
				user's writing style and using it in
				the query-generating algorithm. In this case,
				the tool could send requests such
				as
				"events nearby 2nite" which uses
				shorthand popular among teenagers.</p>

			<p>Moreover,
				the dummy queries should be sent at
				times that match with the user's
				habits.
				People tend to send a burst
				of search requests on one topic.
				For
				instance, one might send a request
				"Where is the closest restaurant?", and
				then search reviews on the
				restaurant found. Thus, if the
				obfuscator
				randomly generates sets of searches
				that go against this logic, it
				becomes a
				simple task for the adversary to
				pick out the true query.</p><br><video controls muted>

			<p class="caption">An example of
				query obfuscation with
				indistinguishability</p>
			<br>
			<p>Consequently,
				the query obfuscator must
				achieve indistinguishability by
				incorporating the user's writing
				style and
				habits into its algorithm.</p>

				<h1 class="whitefont"><b>2.
						Coverage</b></h1><br>
			</div>
			<br><br>
			<p class="requirement">The second
				elementary prerequisite is <b>coverage</b>.</p>
			<p>The dummy queries created by the
				obfuscator should cover a variety
				of topics to make it difficult for
				the adversaries to profile the
				user.
			</p>
			<p>For example, a user who wants to
				buy a flight ticket to Berlin,
				Germany, may type “tickets to
				Berlin” in the search bar. The
				query obfuscator could produce many
				queries with different
				typographical errors such as “tckts
				brn” or “tikets t
				berln”. However, the search engine
				would still be able to conclude
				that all these queries are
				essentially about the same topic,
				which is “tickets to Berlin”.

				not
				support the video tag. </video>
			<p class="caption">An example of
				query obfuscation without coverage</p>
			<br>

			<p>Take another scenario where this
				user’s query obfuscator sends more
				varied queries such as “what to do
				in Paris”, “tickets to Brussels” or
				“sightseeing in Vienna”. Even
				though these queries are
				technically different, the search
				engine would
				still recognise that this
				particular user is planning to
				travel in Europe. Therefore, these
				requests will not be able to fully
				protect the user’s privacy.

			<p class="caption">An example of
				query obfuscation with coverage</p>
			<br>
			<p>Hence, in both cases, the query
				obfuscator should generate queries
				that are unrelated to Europe,
				travelling and flights, so that it
				is more difficult for the web
				search engine to determine the user
				profile.
			</p>
			<p>In general, a successful
				obfuscator should be able to create
				a set of dummy queries about many
				topics that are distinct from one
				another. It is essential to
				implement this feature as its
				absence would result in an
				ineffective obfuscator which
				does not secure users’ information.</p>

						Imprecision</b></h1><br>
			</div>
			<br><br>
			<p class="requirement">The third
				basic requirement for a query
				obfuscator is <b>imprecision</b>.
			</p>
			<p>Most of us have a search history
				with the major search engines on
				the web. With this background
				information about us, adversaries
				can still pick out the true query
				with relative ease, unless the
				obfuscator takes steps against
				this.
			</p>
			<p>Take an example of an office
				worker. During work, they may search
				“how to use countif in excel”.
				Their query obfuscator then
				generates a range of dummy queries,
				such as “how to knit beanie” or
				“plane tickets t las vegas”, to
				deceive the search
				engine adversary.

			<p class="caption">An example of
				query obfuscation without

			<br>
			<p>However, the adversary knows that
				just last week, this worker had
				searched “how to make macros in
				excel” and “what is excel”. It also
				knows the worker’s IP address and
				hence approximate location in the
				business district of the city. With
				this
				information on hand, it is now much
				easier for the adversary to
				identify the original query.
			</p>
			<p>Moreover, the search engine still
				profits even if it cannot identify
				the precise true query. In this
				situation, it can profile the
				worker as someone interested in
				spreadsheet software; in a way,
				their personal information has been
				leaked
				nevertheless.

			<p class="caption">An example of
				query obfuscation with imprecision</p>
			<br>
			<p>Therefore, a functional query
				obfuscator must generate dummy
				queries with topics similar to
				those in the true one. In this
				case, it could send searches about
				other office software, such as
				“crop picture in word” and “add
				account to outlook
				how”. With the range of topics now
				narrowed down, it becomes much more
				difficult for the adversary to pick
				out the true query with high

				<div class="container-fluid">
					<br>
					<p class="requirement">Firstly,
						true indistinguishability is a
						daunting challenge.</p>
					<p>At present, human behaviour
						still cannot be modeled by
						computers with convincing
						success. A query obfuscator would
						need to mimic the user’s grammar,
						language habits and search
						patterns, all of which may not
						conform to an obvious pattern.
						If the software instead applies a
						one-size-fits-all approach to its
						users, an adversary can easily
						pick out the ‘standard’ dummy
						queries from the user’s more
						personalised queries.

					<p>As such, there is no practical

				</div>
				<div class="container-fluid">
					<br>
					<p class="requirement">Next, there
						is a fundamental tension between
						achieving both
						coverage and imprecision.
					</p>
					<p>Coverage requires the
						obfuscator to submit dummy
						queries on
						a range of topics, lest the
						adversary manages to profile the
						user.
					</p>
					<p>However, imprecision requires
						the software to submit queries
						with topics similar to the
						true search’s, such that the
						adversary cannot pick out the
						true query even with existing
						information about the user.
					</p>
					<p>As such, in order to achieve

						an impractically large number of

					<br>
					<p>Hence, due to the numerous
						challenges stacked against it,
						it is unlikely that query
						obfuscation will be effective in fully protecting
						 users' privacy.
					</p>
					<p class="requirement">However,
						other methods of privacy
						protection may hold more promise.</p>
					<p>
						For instance, anonymisation
						networks can disguise the source
						of a user’s queries by leveraging
						on other users in the network.
						One example of these networks is
						a mix network, which receives
						queries from multiple users using
						the network and
						shuffles them before passing them
						to the next mix node in the
						chain. <a href="#ref7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
						This shuffling process is then
						repeated at every mix node of the
						network before the queries
						finally reach the search engine.
					</p>
					</p>
					<p>Each node only possesses
						information on who sent it the
						queries, and
						who to send the mixed queries to
						next. As such, by the time the
						queries reach the search engine,
						it is now highly difficult for
						the adversary to trace the
						original writers of each query.
						In comparison to query
						obfuscation, this eliminates the
						need to model human behaviour to
						reach a similar outcome.
					</p>
					<p>Nevertheless, there still exist
						ways to attack anonymisation
						networks,
						thus additional countermeasures
						must be implemented for these
						methods to succeed in maintaining
						privacy. Even so, compared to
						query obfuscation, such methods
						are more likely to be feasible in
						achieving privacy protection in
						the near future.
